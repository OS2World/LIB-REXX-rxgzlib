rxGZlib ver 1.01 -- GZIP compression procedures for OS/2 REXX

This contains of two dlls that provide GZIP compression procedures 
in an OS/2 REXX callable dynamic link library.

 * rxGZlib.dll is the main library. 
 * src.zip is the source code for rxGZlib
 * tstGzlib.cmd, tst2gzlb.cmd and rxungzip.cmd demonstrate
   rxGZlib procedures.
 * rxGzlib.doc is the documentation for rxGZlib

rxgzlib2.zip is an alternate dll that is under development --
it may eventually contain a richer set of procedures.
